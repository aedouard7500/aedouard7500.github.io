		<h1>A Site for Bully Stoppers</h1>

		<p>For too long, our communities and society brush off bullying as if it's a joke and label it as 'be strong and get over it'. Those mind sets and attitudes need to change. Students and people in general are being bullied into silence. The victims feels as if though they have no voice to speak their minds. Let's break this silence today. We all need to realize bullies who are doing the bullying needs just as much help too and they're also hurting inside!
